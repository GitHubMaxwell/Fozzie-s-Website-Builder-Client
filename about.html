                    <p>I am a future software developer with a background in the sciences and a passion for the outdoors. I am committed to lifelong learning and professional development. My interests include the intersection of science and technology, geospatial analysis, and translating scientific language into terms that non-scientists can understand. Plant identification, hiking, rhetoric, travel, and learning about psychology are some of my main hobbies. I love cats.

                    <p>I went to school at Northwest Nazarene University where I graduated with a BA in Music Industry, which means I got to spend quite of bit of time in studio recording, mixing, editing and mastering but also got a traditional musical education. My primary instrument is guitar but I have also learned how to play piano, bass and ukulele.
<p>
After school I got hired on full time at Inspirational Family Radio where I primarily worked for 94.1 The Voice doing web design and creating the On-Air product. I spent over two years at IFR creating spots, commercials, programs, logos and connections with great leaders of the Treasure Valley and around the world. 
<p>
Now I'm attending Code Fellows and pursuing a Career in Software Development and Full-Stack JavaScript.
